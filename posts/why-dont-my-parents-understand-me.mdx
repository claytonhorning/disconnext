It’s usually not because they aren’t trying. It’s because they lack the necessary experiences and skills to effectively deal with mental health in the digital age.

Your parents likely grew up in a time where things were a lot simpler, at least in regards to being social. If you wanted to hangout with your friend, you would call them or even show up knocking at their door. If you wanted to go out on a date with someone, they wouldn’t have the chance to stalk you online beforehand - which usually instills false ideas and perceptions.

Being social was just much simpler. The biggest difference though, is that when they were done interacting with their friends or their middle school crush, they would go home and likely not communicate until the next time they saw each other.

Today, it’s much different. The line of communication is always open. When you go home after school, a lingering anxiety in the air exists because of the technology we now have access to.

Should you text your friends about what happened at school? Should you message that cute girl/boy that you have a crush on? Or will they message you first? Should you send them a dank meme?

You decide to send a message to that girl that you have a crush on.

<Message recipient="to">Heyyyy hows it going?</Message>

A minute goes by… no response.

Two minutes go by… no response.

5 minutes go by… you see that she is active on Instagram and Snapchat. You know that she saw your message, but she hasn’t responded. Is it because she doesn’t want to talk to you?

Anxiety sets in.

20 more minutes go by… she responded!!!

<Message>Hey, whats up?</Message>

Okay… she didn’t respond for a while so you should probably do the same, right? To make it seem like you are busy and not just waiting around for her message.

Then, the same series of events happen to the other person.

This is all just to say “Hey” and receive a response of “Hey, whats up?”. When you analyze it this way, it seems ridiculous. But humans are social creatures that crave interaction with other people. This is a normal response to this situation for someone who grew up in the digital age.

It does not mean that you have ADHD, an anxiety disorder, or depression, not to say that it’s not a possibility.

For older generations, they simply don’t understand how someone could assign so much meaning to a thing that isn’t _even real_.

## The biggest difference between you and your parents

Here’s what a lot of it comes down to. For those of us who grew up with technology and social media, our identity and self-worth is much more intertwined with our online lives.

For someone to read your message and not respond is almost like saying “Hey” to someone in person (real life) and for them to stare blankly at you and not say anything.

What do you do in that situation? Pretty awkward, right? That would make the vast majority of adults anxious and uncomfortable.

This anxiety that exists when you are waiting to receive a response is just one of the struggles of growing up in a digital age among others such as feeling inadequate, FOMO (fear of missing out), and other physical consequences.

Because your parents didn’t grow up with social media, they can’t even be>gin to understand the nuances that exist when you combine this technology with a developing person’s brain.

This means that they likely:

#### 1. Have a hard time knowing what advice to give

> "Very rarely do you have one of these generational shifts where the generation that leads, like parents who guide their children, have such a different set of experiences that they don't have the context to support their children in a safe way."

#### 2. Don’t know the best way to limit your usage of social media and technology

Although your parents are just trying to help, it might not seem like it when they limit your social media usage or ban it all together.

Usually this doesn't work anyways, as those who have grown up with this technology find ways to bypass the parental features or sneak some screen time somehow.

#### 3. Don’t understand that social media and technology is somewhat of a necessity in today's age

There are obviously many positive effects of technology and social media which makes them necessary for most people. The goal isn’t to ban it all together.

This is what is unique about social media. Most addictions and habits that are negatively affecting our lives, we can divorce ourselves from. If eating too many twinkies is making us fat, we can not have twinkies in the house. If video games are distracting us from doing our work, we can get rid of the PS4.

But our relationship with social media needs to be improved through our mindset, not a rule.

#### 4. Don’t know how the apps even work half of the time! Boomers.

Not only do they not know how it can make you feel, but they often don’t even know how the apps work in general.

For example, they likely don’t know that you can see when someone was last active, see where they are on Snap Maps, or that you feel like you need to keep your streaks.

## Parents are also struggling with anxiety from social media

In a [recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2786464?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=112321), 5395 adults whose average as was 56 reported that their usage of Snapchat, Facebook, and TikTok had a negative impact on their mental health.

This is a phenomenon that isn’t just affecting young people. It becomes increasingly difficult for parents to help their children when they are facing the exact same set of problems and do not know how to best help themselves.

The reality is that this is new to all of us and there aren’t a lot of great resources available that allow people to have a better relationship with social media. The best psychologists and engineers in the world are working hard to addict us to these platforms because that is where all the money lies.
