Why is it so hard to keep these apps off of your phone? What can you do about it?

Summary:
Quitting social media as a teen is difficult because the platforms are made to addict you and profit off of your time spent in the app. There are also other social pressures such as feeling that you will miss out or lose friends. Beyond this, you may just not know how to be bored and need something to fill the time. The solution is a change in your mindset and disconnecting your identity and self-worth from your online presence.

### Social media is designed to be addicting

**Problem:**

Some of the best minds in the world are working at Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok. Psychologists, Neuroscientists, Engineers, Designers, What is their job? To make sure that you spend as much time as possible scrolling through their feed.

Why? Because that’s how they make money. You are a user. Someone that they are trying to addict.

Every feature has been designed and engineered in a way that makes you want to continue using the application. It targets your emotions and the way that we think as humans.

When you delete the app, you may find yourself scrolling to where it used to be on your homepage. That is a true sign that it has become something that you depend on for a quick dopamine boost. Your brain is subconsciously trying to get onto the app so that you can see new photos, see your likes, followers, and comments.

**Mindset Shift:**

Combatting something that targets your chemical makeup isn’t easy. Not becoming addicted to social media platforms takes a lot of conscious effort.

If you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through feeds with no conscious intentions, you need to change how you view social media. There are things you can do such as use screen time to limit the amount of time you spend in the app, turn off notifications, turn your phone to grayscale to make everything black and white... to make it less interesting, or delete your account altogether.

However, these aren’t solving the problem. The problem is that you need to change how you view social media. You need to detach your self-worth and your identity from how you are perceived online.

This way, it is a lot less meaningful when you get a like on your post, or don’t get any likes at all. This shouldn’t be something that you monitor every 5 seconds after you post a photo.

The amount of likes you get has **ZERO** correlation with how much people care about you or how attractive you are.

If you can assign less value to these features that big tech companies have designed in a lab, you will be able to feel less attached to your online profiles.

### We already live in the metaverse

**Problem:**

Growing up with technology likely means that much of your social life and identity revolves around social media. You may feel like your Instagram page is an addition to yourself.

That’s how you express your personality over the internet. That’s where people will see you and make a first impression.

It’s obvious why you don’t want to delete something that is a part of yourself. Especially if you have accumulated posts and memories that you don’t want to lose. This makes it extremely hard to delete social media because it feels like you are losing something.

**Mindset Shift:**

First impressions should not be made through social media. If someone is judging you based on a few pictures that were taken with a small metal brick, then you have to think about whether you even care what they are thinking at all.

Social media often gives people a false perception of who we are and doesn’t capture even a fraction of our personalities.

People who decide whether or not they like someone based on their Instagram profiles are shallow… don’t be one of those people.

Deleting your profile because you don’t want to lose your pictures may be an excuse you can tell to an old timer… but we both know that you have those photos in your camera roll. Those are memories that will be on your phone regardless and they don’t lose any value if you are the only one that is able to see them.

### Missing out / Not being able to communicate with friends

**Problem:**

When your friends primarily communicate through Instagram or Snapchat and you do not have those applications, you may feel like you are unable to communicate with them.

Yes, there are other methods of communication, but they may be less convenient and not be able to portray the same message. For example, if you and your friend usually send memes or funny videos over Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok, then it is much easier to talk within those applications.

You also might miss out on events or things that people only talk about online. This fear of missing out makes it very difficult to keep social media apps off of your phone.

**Mindset Shift:**

<Message recipient="to">
  Heyyy remember about this thing called texting?
</Message>

So you’re worried about not being able to see dank memes if you delete your socials? Well, you can still see them. It might be a little bit harder for people to send them because they can’t send it on the platform they found it on - they likely will have to send it through text which adds an extra layer of effort.

This is a good thing. If it is something that they really want you to see, they will find a way to send it if they have half a brain. If sending that TikTok or meme is too much effort, then you probably didn’t need to see it anyway.

Have a conversation with your friends and family about where they should keep in touch with you. If you both want to keep in touch with each other, you will. If the platform where you communicate matters that much, then maybe you shouldn’t be keeping in touch.

### What will others think about me

**Problem:**

In a generation that grew up with social media, it’s sort of like going to the bathroom - everyone does it.

If you don’t use social media, then you are seen as different.

Others may think that you are weird for not wanting to use social media. They may think that you don’t care about them enough to keep the applications so that you can keep in touch with them.

Not only that, but when someone looks you up on social media and finds that you don’t have an account, some people may find it strange. The fact that they aren’t able to stalk you will likely frustrate them.

**Mindset Shift:**

So you are going to look different? Good.

Everyone is trying to be different and stand out. Being able to be different by not doing anything is basically a cheat code.

Not having a social media presence will make people have a sense of curiosity and suspense toward you because they aren’t able to stalk you.

If they truly think you are weird in a bad way, then it’s not worth your time.

### Pressure from friends and family

**Problem:**

Another reason you may not be able to keep those apps off your phone is because your friends and family keep pressuring you to re-download them.

If you deleted the applications off your phone but didn’t delete your account, it is very hard to resist getting the apps back on your phone because you may have messages waiting for you from friends and family.

Especially if they say

<Message>Did you see that video I sent on Instagram?</Message>

They also may try to make you feel guilty by saying that not having social media means you will be less in touch with them.

**Mindset Shift:**

Social media messaging is not usually time sensitive. What I mean is, if someone really wants to get a hold of you, they will text or call. Not send a dancing video on TikTok.

Pressure from friends and family can easily be dealt with by a simple explanation that you don't want to use social media as much and prefer another method of communication.

### Feeling validated

**Problem:**

As a teen, it feels very important to be validated and accepted by your peers. You are trying to make your way and find your people. Social life is a very important part of developing as a person.

Social media is a great way to receive instant feedback, for good or for bad. When you post a photo, every like and comment that you receive is a dopamine boost and is validation that people “like you”.

If you have become accustomed to feeling this way from social media, it can be hard to resist. You may feel like redownloading social media just to get those same feelings of validation and reinforcement of your self-worth.

**Mindset Shift:**

Social media doesn’t show the real you. That means that if people like your picture, it doesn’t mean they like you. They might just be hoping that you return the favor when they post a picture.

If they don’t like your picture, it doesn’t mean they don’t like you. They may not have seen it or they may be jealous of you. There are so many reasons why someone may not like your post.

Again, the solution is to start detaching your self-worth from these platforms.

### Don’t know what to do with boredom

**Problem:**

Some people simply don’t know how to be bored. Sitting in silence and not doing anything is unheard of to them.

When you grow up with a device that fits in your hand which can cure boredom in a matter of seconds, why would you ever choose to be bored?

Using social media may just be a default when you are not sure of what else to do. When everyone else is on their phones, it seems that you should be too. It can be awkward to be with a group of people who are all on their phones while you sit in silence twiddling your thumbs.

**Mindset Shift:**

Being bored is a good thing!

> Being bored can help foster creativity… Additionally, being bored can improve overall brain health. [Source](https://www.newswise.com/articles/let-your-brain-rest-boredom-can-be-good-for-your-health#:~:text=Being%20bored%20can%20help%20foster,is%20associated%20with%20feeling%20good.)

Just sit and let yourself be bored. You don’t need to be talking to someone all the time. You don’t need to be watching something all the time.

When everyone else is on their phones, you can be the friend that suggests a different activity and gets everyone back into real life. Or, you can just sit and be with yourself and your thoughts. This may seem like a weird thing today, but there used to be no other alternative.
